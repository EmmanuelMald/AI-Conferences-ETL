# AI-Conferences-ETL

Project that extracts AI-related events. The objective is to upload some AI events in a SharePoint list

Currently, the pipeline only extracts the events and stores it in a linked folder to OneDrive, which then executes another pipeline using PowerAutomate.

This project soon will be deleted, it was only for testing
